##Web-Data Tools
These are a bunch of different web and data related projects I'm keeping in this repo. Expect to find things related to search, web scraping, and data visualization.

##Scrapers
Indeed Jobs - Scrapes the xml returned from Indeed.com's publisher API tool. 
UIUC SVN - Scrapes some files from an svn repo just because.

##Job Search
This project is a little different from the others. It began as a project for Boilermake 2014 (Purdue's Hackathon)
but evolved into some I was doing so I could learn more about Elasticsearch. Being a Solr user in the past,
this understaking was definitely worth my time and now I can build search with both :)

A python script is used to scrap job postings off of Indeed.com through it's API. That's a strange thing 
to do, I agree, but this was my first scraper so I wanted something I could easily extract data with.

Cheers.
